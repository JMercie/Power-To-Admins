## Installation

Work in progress...

## Appendix

As a Salesforce administrator you sometimes need to know a lot of stuff, and git now days needs to be one of those things, with this (hopefully) friendly GUI, you will be able to use basic git commands, retrieve metadata from the org you made changes and push everything to the source control system of your team.

This come with a lot of benefits, because you will be able to easily version control all your automation's and other kind of metadata you track in your sandbox!
